The court\u2019s landmark judgment held that capital punishment violates the rights to life and dignity, and constitutes cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment. It invalidated the statute permitting the death sentence and prohibited any executions under that law. This was the new Court\u2019s first major human-rights decision, affirming that even the worst criminals must not be deprived of life and dignity by the state.",

The Constitutional Court stressed that courts must \"infuse elements of grace and compassion into the formal structures of the law\" when considering eviction applications. It held that an eviction order should only be granted if it is just and equitable after considering all relevant circumstances, including the needs of vulnerable groups (such as children, the elderly and women-headed households) and whether alternative land or accommodation is available. The judgment pioneered a mediated, humane approach to evictions, balancing the property rights of landowners with the dignity and housing rights of unlawful occupiers.",

The Court unanimously held that the common-law definition of marriage and the Marriage Act, to the extent that they excluded same-sex couples, violated the equality clause (section 9 of the Constitution) and the dignity of gay and lesbian people. Writing for the Court, Sachs J ruled that the heterosexist definition was unfairly discriminatory and could not be justified. The Court suspended its order for one year to allow Parliament to cure the defect by amending or enacting legislation to include same-sex couples in the institution of marriage. This decision paved the way for the Civil Union Act 2006, making South Africa the first African country to recognise same-sex marriage.",

    "summary": "This decision broke new ground in holding the state accountable for failing to protect individuals from violent crime. The applicant, a woman who was brutally attacked by a man released on bail despite a history of sexual violence, sued the police and prosecutors for negligence. The Constitutional Court held that the State can be delictually liable for harm caused by its omission to protect a person when reasonable steps by police or prosecutors could have prevented the harm. The Court invoked section 39(2) of the Constitution, which obliges courts to develop the common law in line with the \u201cspirit, purport and objects\u201d of the Bill of Rights. It found that the lower courts had failed to give effect to this duty, and it ordered that the negligence claim be reconsidered in light of the Constitution. Carmichele thus affirmed that public authorities have a duty of care to act against known threats, especially to protect the rights of women against gender-based violence.",

    "summary": "A seminal property rights case in which an indigenous community successfully claimed restoration of their ancestral land and mineral rights. The Richtersveld Community had been dispossessed of their land (rich in diamonds) by discriminatory laws during the apartheid era. The Constitutional Court found that, under the customary law of the community (Nama law), they held a communal ownership right in the land and its minerals, which had never been extinguished by the colonial annexation. The Court held that indigenous customary law must be recognised as part of South African law, and that the community\u2019s rights, though unrecognized by colonial and apartheid authorities, survived as \u201ca form of communal ownership\u201d protected by the Constitution. It concluded that the dispossession of the Richtersveld land was racially discriminatory, entitling the community to restitution of the land and diamond mining rights under the Restitution of Land Rights Act 1994.",

    "date": "2004-10-15",
    "summary": "A major inheritance law case that struck down the male-only rule of succession in African customary law for being unconstitutional. The applicants challenged the customary law principle of primogeniture (as applied through section 23 of the Black Administration Act 1927 and related regulations), which prevented women and extra-marital children from inheriting. The Constitutional Court held that this regime, which only allowed male descendants or relatives to inherit, violated the equality (section 9) and dignity (section 10) rights of women and children. Langa DCJ, writing for the Court, found the discrimination unjustifiable in a democratic society founded on equality. The Court invalidated the offending provisions and ordered that estates previously governed by African customary law should instead devolve according to the Intestate Succession Act, with modifications to ensure children born outside marriage are included. Bhe thus reformed intestate succession to be gender-equal and compatible with the Bill of Rights.",

    "summary": "The first Constitutional Court case to directly consider the right of access to sufficient water (section 27(1)(b) of the Constitution). Five residents of Soweto challenged the City of Johannesburg\u2019s installation of prepaid water meters and the provision of 6 kilolitres of free water per household per month, arguing that this limited free basic water allocation was inadequate for their needs. The Constitutional Court, in a unanimous judgment by O\u2019Regan J, held that the City\u2019s Free Basic Water policy was reasonable and thus met the state\u2019s obligations under the Constitution. The Court declined to specify a quantified minimum amount of water as a constitutional entitlement, emphasizing a deferential, reasonableness-based approach (as in Grootboom and TAC). It overturned a lower court order that had set a higher free allowance, finding that the City\u2019s ongoing revisions to its water policy fell within the bounds of what is constitutionally \u201creasonable\u201d. Mazibuko affirmed that socio-economic rights do not demand rigid standards from courts, but reasonable government measures.",

    "summary": "This judgment clarified the duty of municipalities to provide emergency housing to homeless people evicted by private landowners. In Blue Moonlight, 86 poor occupiers faced eviction from a privately owned building. The Constitutional Court held that even when an eviction is sought by a private owner, a city is constitutionally obliged to provide temporary accommodation to occupants who would become homeless as a result. It found that the City of Johannesburg\u2019s housing policy unlawfully excluded people evicted from private land and was thus unreasonable. The Court ordered that the occupiers could not be evicted unless the City provided alternative shelter for them, and it directed the City to \u201cplan and budget proactively\u201d for housing in eviction cases. This case ensured that municipalities cannot avoid their responsibility to prevent homelessness, even in evictions by private parties.",

The majority held that the Constitution celebrates diversity and that reasonable accommodation of sincerely held religious or cultural practices is required in schools. Forcing the learner to choose between her education and her cultural identity was unjustifiable. The Court ordered the school to permit the nose stud as an exemption to the dress code, affirming that pluralism and tolerance must be respected in educational institutions.",

The Constitutional Court held that an occupier has the right to make reasonable improvements for dignified living conditions, even without the consent of the owner. Interpreting ESTA in light of the Constitution\u2019s values of dignity and equality, the Court found that preventing such improvements would perpetuate historical indignities. The majority (Madlanga J) ruled that the occupier\u2019s right to human dignity allows her to bring her dwelling to a standard fit for human habitation at her own expense. The case underscores that security of tenure under ESTA includes living with basic dignity.",
