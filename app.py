### üìò Scope of Coverage

OpenLaw SA is built on publicly accessible, high-integrity sources -- including SAFLII, Laws.Africa, the Government Gazette, and AfricanLII. This gives you reliable access to court judgments, legislation, and official legal notices across South Africa.

We focus on providing structured, plain-language insight into South African law -- but we currently do **not** include:
- Proprietary headnotes or annotations from commercial databases
- Academic legal commentary or treatises
- Procedural practice directives or Bar circulars

Our mission is to bridge that gap over time -- starting with transparent, structured law that everyone can access and understand.



### üìò Scope of Coverage
OpenLaw SA is committed to providing accessible and reliable legal information to South African legal professionals. Our platform currently includes:

- **Case Law**: Judgments from various South African courts, sourced from the Southern African Legal Information Institute (SAFLII).
- **Legislation**: National and provincial legislation, as well as municipal by-laws, obtained through partnerships with organizations like Laws.Africa.
- **Government Gazettes**: Official notices and publications from the Government Gazette Archives.

While we strive to offer comprehensive legal resources, please note that our platform does not currently include:

- **Proprietary Legal Commentaries**: Such as those found in subscription-based services like LexisNexis or Juta.
- **Academic Legal Journals**: Articles and analyses published in legal journals and periodicals.
- **Practice Manuals and Directives**: Internal guidelines and procedural manuals used within specific legal institutions.

We are continually working to expand our database and welcome feedback on additional resources that would benefit our users.



### üë• Who's Behind This?
